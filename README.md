# STA160 Project

This project hopes to explore tennis and what differentiates players from one another.

# Dataset

The dataset we are using is from the <a href="https://github.com/serve-and-volley/atp-world-tour-tennis-data" target="_blank">ATP World Tour tennis data</a> repository, which contains data scraped from the ATP website until October 2017. We have updated these scripts to hopefully gather data for the recent years as well.
